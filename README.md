# Software-Renderer
 This is a Software implemented graphics pipeline/ray-tracing system, based on c++ (17) and openframework.

It consists of three independent systems.
### 0. Software Renderer-C++ implemented Graphics Pipeline
> + Load & store  triangle obj meshes (xxx.obj file ), compute per-vertex/ per-face normal if needed.
> + Camera Rotation, Pan moving, Zoom in & Out .
> + Object moving & roation: Arcball controls.
> + Early-Z & Z-buffer technique; Multi-thread rasterization; Gouraud shading/Phong shading;
> + Image texture & Procedural texture: stripe.
> + Procedural landmass: marching cube to generate a random landmass.
> + Skybox.
> + Perspective correct interpolation.

|Operation  | Instruction | 
| -----| ----- |
| Objects Select |Press R will change the mutable object that is selected. |
| Objects transformation | Keep Shift Pressed to enable model transformation.  Press W, A, S, D and Q, E to Translate in x, y, z direction. Arc-ball rotation with right mouse.Press R(shift+R) to reset its postion. |
|Camera motion | Press W, A, S, D and Q, E to Translate Camera in x, y, z direction. Press Y, U, O, P to rotate in pitch and yaw direction of the camera. |

### 1.1 Implicit surface ray-tracing system  
> + Model transformation:Rotation, Scale, Translate in x, y, z direction, Reset Object position
> + Camera transformation: movement, zoom in zoom out
> + ray-tracing implicit surfaces: sphere,eliptical, plane, triangle, Cone, cube, tetrahedron.
> + small bonus: animation(activate by press KEY V)

### 1.2 TriangleMesh ray-tracing system  
> + Add triangle meshes support into simple ray-tracing system.(Support  xx.obj file )
> + Toggling between Predefined/per-face normal.In runtime, normal are interpolated using the barycentric coordinates.
> + A bounding volume hierarchy to traverse the scene(adaptively split triangles and all mesh objects)(50s/frame->15fps)
> + Implement antialiasing using distribution ray tracing with the stratified super sampling technique.
> + Implement soft shadows using distribution ray tracing
  


### Manual
> for  ray-tracing system First of all you need to use left button of mouse to click to select an object, once this object is selected, itâ€™s color turns to purple, and later instruction all apply to this object. If you want cancel selection, click mid-button of your mouse.

### Environment 
- Windows 10/Linux;
- OpenFrameworks v0.11.0( __latest version has remove this dependency and directly use operating system window API__);
- c++ 17 or higher: STL thread library is used for multi-thread acceleration

### How to setup the code
There are two ways to setup the code:
- 0.__Cmakefile__ is provide for linux. 
- 1.On windows, You can open the corresponding xxxx.sln in vs-studio-project folder (If you have openframeworks with visual studio this should work).



### Reference & Miscs
